        <div class="subheading mb-5">AccountantðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Andrew Song and I am currently a third-year transfer student at the University of California, Riverside, where I major in accounting. Before I was enrolled at a four-year university I was a student at Fullerton College. Ever since high school, I began to help around more in the house. Of the chores that I had to do, one of them was helping my dad with his taxes. I began understanding what each form meant and began to see each intricate layer that accountants have to look at. I noticed that filing taxes with my dad did not seem like a chore at all, it is actually something that I genuinely enjoy doing. Since then, I have always known that accounting is the major for me and that I want to be an accountant for one of the Big Four companies.<br><br>

        Being at a junior college first has taught me that no matter where you are in life, it is never too late to reach your dreams. At first, I felt very behind because, while all my friends were attending four-year universities, I was still at a junior college. I noticed that the other people in my class were not like me at all. The age range between each student was so diverse and yet everybody sitting in my class all had the same goal - to get a degree. Despite our differences, all my peers were filled with so much determination and hope to pursue their dreams even though our backgrounds were all different. I began to understand that not everyoneâ€™s lives are going to be the same. Not everybody has to enter a four-year university right after high school to have a career. Not everybody has to get a degree to make themselves known. And not everybody has to have their major picked out right away. Everything is completely fine. The school that students attend do not define who they are, they do.<br><br>

        After two years in a junior college, I was able to right my wrongs from highschool and bring my priorities and goals back on track. I applied to a wide range of schools and decided to go to the University of Calfornia, Riverside. Ever since my transfer, I have entered into a world of diversity, acceptance, and dreams. There are so many majors and minors that this school provides and even with the variety of choices, I would still pick accounting. In my opinion, accounting is a very stable job and one that I can see myself doing in the upcoming future. Since my transfer, I have made many new friends and broadened my network with the accounting society club (Beta Alpha Psi) that I joined. I met a whole other group of individuals who like the same things I do and want to pursue the same career I do. It brings me great honor to be able to figure out life and to aim towards my dreams with people who understand what it takes and what is needed to reach there.
